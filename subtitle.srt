Hi, Holberton. My name is Naomi Srel. I'm from Batch 2, and I'm here to talk to you about the console.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're super excited for you to start out on your Airbnb project.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The console is going to be very similar to Shell, except it's a single use function, a command line interface,

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
from which you can create, modify, and delete objects in your file storage.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're probably asking yourself, why would I want to do that? The client's not going to, but see this is a tool,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
it's a sandbox, if you will, where you can play around with ideas, see what does, and doesn't work in storage,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
before you build out the rest of your web application. Have fun, we hope you enjoy.
